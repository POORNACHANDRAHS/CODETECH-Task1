OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

**Project Name:** Simple Calculator in Java

**Description:**
This project is a command-line based simple calculator built using Java. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. The program runs in a loop, enabling users to continuously perform calculations until they decide to exit.

**Features:**
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** The calculator supports the five fundamental arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
  - Modulus (`%`)
- **User Input:** Users are prompted to input two numbers and choose the desired arithmetic operation.
- **Input Validation:** The program handles cases where division or modulus operations involve zero, preventing runtime errors and providing appropriate error messages.
- **Looping Structure:** The calculator runs in an infinite loop, allowing users to perform multiple calculations in a single session. Users can exit the program by entering '0' as the operator.
- **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling for invalid operator inputs and divide-by-zero scenarios.

**How to Use:**
1. Run the program.
2. Enter two numbers when prompted.
3. Choose an arithmetic operation by entering the corresponding operator.
4. The result of the operation is displayed.
5. Continue with additional calculations or enter '0' to exit the program.

**Technologies Used:**
- Java
- Java Scanner class for user input

**Conclusion:**
This project serves as a basic example of using Java for simple mathematical calculations.
